    </div class="text-center"><h3>Characters</h3></div>

        
    </div class="col-lg-2">Monkey D. Luffy
    <p>(モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirate and the main protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives him rubbery attributes. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, a local runaway noble. </p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Roronoa Zoro
<p>Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ) is a swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood friend and rival, he aims to defeat "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk and become the world's greatest swordsman.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro).

    Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo, the spoiled son of a navy officer. To prevent the harm of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.[ch. 2–6] However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him on as a student.[ch. 51f., 485, 597] Zoro is capable of utilizing all three types of Haki and is capable of using the advanced application for both and Haoshoku and Busoshoku Haki. He is known for his awful sense of direction and constantly gets lost when traveling. </p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Nami
<p>Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Belle-Mère, Nami (ナミ) witness their mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami).</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Usopp
<p>During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu) is abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. As his mother, Bachina, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will return and take them out to sea. He regularly goes to the mansion at the top of the hill where he lives, to visit Kaya. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate.</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Sanji
<p>Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced siblings and is locked away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes and flees Germa, a floating kingdom composed of several ships, after it enters the East Blue and his father permits it.

    While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary area where the East, West, North, and South Blue seas meet, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands he needs for cooking.[ch. 48, 370] He has a weakness for women and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Tony Tony Chopper
<p>Tony Tony Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā) is a doctor and a blue-nosed reindeer. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations for three minutes.[ch. 149] With help from Caesar Clown, Chopper can last in his transformations for about 30 minutes.</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Nico Robin
<p>Being raised in Ohara (オハラ), home of the world's oldest and largest library, Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight.[ch. 218,391f.] At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit (ハナハナの実, Hana Hana no Mi), which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, which spring up on surfaces near her.[ch. 170] Behind her teachers' backs, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyphs (歴史の本文ポーネグリフ, Pōnegurifu, alt. Poneglyphs), which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the elusive Real Ponegliff (真の歴史の本文リオ・ポーネグリフ, Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history referred to as the 100-Year Void (空白の100年, Kūhaku no Hyaku-nen, Void Century).[ch. 218] However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Franky
<p>The son of pirate parents who abandoned him at age nine, Cutty Flam (カティ・フラム, Kati Furamu) changed his name to Franky (フランキー, Furankī) and is taken in as an apprentice by shipwright Tom, who built Pirate King Gol D Roger's ship, the Oro Jackson, and also secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon.[ch. 344, 354, 427] Franky's recklessness eventually provides an opportunity for World Government agents seeking these plans.[ch. 356] Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with strength.[ch. 336, 339, 352, 357f.] After gaining notoriety as "Cyborg" Franky (サイボーグ フランキー, Saibōgu Furankī), and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.</p>
</div class="col-lg-2">Brook
<p>Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" Brook (ブルック, Burukku) first enters the Grand Line as a member of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving their pet, the infant whale Laboon (ラブーン, Rabūn), at Reverse Mountain, they promise to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] After losing their captain "Calico" Yorki (キャラコのヨーキ, Kyarako no Yōki), Brook took over the crew as the new captain. Some time later, they are annihilated, but the power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実, Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows "Dead Bones" Brook to rise again and live a second life as a skeleton.[ch. 443] Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise, and to that end he joins the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
